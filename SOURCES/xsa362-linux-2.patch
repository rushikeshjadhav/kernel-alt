Subject: xen-netback: don't "handle" error by BUG()

In particular -ENOMEM may come back here, from set_foreign_p2m_mapping().
Don't make problems worse, the more that handling elsewhere (together
with map's status fields now indicating whether a mapping wasn't even
attempted, and hence has to be considered failed) doesn't require this
odd way of dealing with errors.

This is part of XSA-362.
